This is our project, which has a purpose to alert the user whenever the potentiometer's value is over a certain amount. This potentiometer can easily be replaced by other sensors such as temperature sensors, humidity sensors, CO2 concentration sensors and NO2 concentration sensors that can be useful for various reasons. After this device alerts users, they can take action depending on the severity of the issue with the various outputs in our device

Due to the limited size of the breadboard, there are only 5 components of this device including three outputs and two inputs. The potentiometer is the first input device in which the sensor can be replaced by any other sensor, depending on the intending purpose of the user. The second input is the button, where the user presses the button to alert the user whether there is a problem that the sensor is detecting. These are sent to the PicoW in which the code assesses the input values and sends them to the output values. The fist output is the onboard LED on the PicoW Raspberry Pi. This is a small green LED that turns on when the potentiometer has a reading of under 50000. However, this can be changed to the unit of measurement for each sensor. The second output is the external LED where
