This was our final project as we combined everything we have learnt throughout our progress. We added an external LED, a button, the potentiometer and even a buzzer in which we quickly learnt how to use it. This took many lessons of trial and error and the information from all the tutorials in order to get a functional device, capable of keeping homeowners safe.
