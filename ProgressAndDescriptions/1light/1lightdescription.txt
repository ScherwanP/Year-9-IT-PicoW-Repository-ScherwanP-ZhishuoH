This first sign of progress was an introduction to Pico Ws and it helped us learn the basics. Our first challenge was to create an external light to turn on and off. We learnt the basics on understanding the concepts of wiring and how to input code into the device. After a few minutes of tinkering and watching YouTube tutorials, we managed to make one LED turn on. However, this still didnâ€™t fully help us understand the mechanics of the Pico Ws and how it completely works.
