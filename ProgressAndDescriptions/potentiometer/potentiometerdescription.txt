This was the first time we had a sensor input as the determining factor for our output. But first, we tried to register the input of the sensor and tried to get a reading. This was much more difficult as the potentiometer is a resistive-type transducer that basically converts linear or angular displacement into an output voltage, and it has three cables. We watched another tutorial in helping us understand how to receive a reading from the potentiometer. Eventually, we managed to print the potentiometer values into the console. By turning the knob, the potentiometer value changes as well.
