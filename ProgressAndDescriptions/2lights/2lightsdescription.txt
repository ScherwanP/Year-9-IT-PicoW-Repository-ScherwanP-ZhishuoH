It was much easier to create a device that can turn on one light as there are a number of tutorials on YouTube. However, doing two lights was much more difficult as there were little to no sources online to create two LEDs. However, we quickly understood the concept of creating devices like this as they were similar to electrical circuits like we learnt in Science. Although we still had little knowledge on the Pico W itself, we understood that we need two separate cables and followed similar instructions to the 1 LED tutorial. As well as this, we understood that we needed to change to code to apply it for different GPIO pins as well.
