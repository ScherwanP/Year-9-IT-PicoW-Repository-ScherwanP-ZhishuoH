The light and button was much more complicated that the two lights. The reason for this is that we needed to process an input for the first time. The button was much more complex as well as it required two inputs and outputs rather than the single input and output on the external LED. After watching a tutorial and applying knowledge from the previous task, we were quick to understand how it works and build a device that works. We were surprised to see what little code we needed and eventually managed to get a blinking light from a button.
